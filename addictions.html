    <h2>Addictions/Inner city clinic</h2>
    <p>o	Clinic at HSC that anyone admitted with SUD complications (especially with injection drug use and severe AUD) can be referred to and seen on a rapid basis.
        o	Start-off by focusing on Naltrexone and PrEP and expand care as needed.
        o	Have clinic run 4 days/week. One day at HSC, the other 3 days in the community such as at Sunshine House, Main Street Project, Bell Hotel etc.  
        o	Multiple clinicians would be part of the clinic and ideally people would work a week at a time (similar to HIV clinic).
        o	Provide Harm Reduction services
        o	Would ideally have nurse, social worker, Indigenous Elder, People with lived experience and academic researcher associated with clinic. 
        o	Residents could rotate through these clinics as well.
        o	Training in R5 year is required, details TBD.
