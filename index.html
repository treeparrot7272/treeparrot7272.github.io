      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        General Internal Medicine at the University of Manitoba is an approximately 50 person section split between three acute care hospitals. 
        We staff the Clinical Teaching Units (at all sites), see patients in clinic, provide education to residents and students, and are involved in administrative duties. We meet monthly for journal clubs or section rounds in a casual setting as well. We work as a team in providing patient-centred care.
