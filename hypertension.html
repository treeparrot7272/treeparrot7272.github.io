    <p>Our Hypertension clinic is a subspecialty, multidisciplinary clinic located within a tertiary care academic hospital in Winnipeg. Our vision is to: 
    <ol> Provide exceptional care and comprehensive management for patients with hypertension</ol> 
    <ol>Optimize hypertension management through a patient-centered approach
    </ol>
    <ol> Remain updated with the latest research and incorporate evidence-based therapies and innovative treatment strategies into our practice.
    </ol>   
    <ol> Actively support the growth and development of medical residents by offering them unique learning opportunities.
    </ol> 
    
   <p> Residents have the chance to engage in a variety of educational experiences, ranging from single-day exposures to week-long rotations or extended training spanning six months or a year. We are proud to provide exposure and training in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, a requirement of the Royal College for all General Internal Medicine subspecialty residents. </p>

  <p>    In the future, we aim to have 4 to 5 specialist physicians at our clinic, each participating in 1-2 Hypertension Clinics per week. Physicians are encouraged very strongly to go away for this training. These physicians will have backgrounds in General Internal Medicine (GIM), Nephrology, Endocrinology, or Cardiology, and bring longitudinal experience with recognized hypertension clinics. The ideal GIM physician will have additional training and expertise in Bariatric Medicine, Stroke Neurology, or Research (which will help our clinic contribute to the advancement of hypertension knowledge and treatment through active participation in research initiatives). The ideal physician will possess the American Hypertension Specialist Certification Program Certified Hypertension Specialist (AHS-CHS) designation. In the future we will have at least 1 comprehensive multidisciplinary clinic per month that includes physicians, Nurses, Dieticians, and Pharmacists working collaboratively to provide comprehensive care. Depending on the patient's needs, they may see one or all of these clinicians during their visit.   </p>
