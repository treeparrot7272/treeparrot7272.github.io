    <h2>Thrombosis - Dr.Rhys Sharkey</h2>
    <p>The vision for this program (and at least somewhat similar to what is offered at other comparable centres across Canada) is to grow to 5 half-day clinics per week. This would allow for relatively rapid initial assessment of patients with new confirmed VTE (within 1-2 weeks of diagnosis) with plans for one additional follow-up appointment at the end of their 3-6 month treatment period.  In addition to providing the patient with information regarding signs and symptoms of recurrent VTE/major bleeding that should prompt their presentation to medical attention, at the second visit a plan would be made with respect to the following questions: 
        •	Is indefinite oral anticoagulation required?
        •	If indefinite OAC is required, what agent should be used and at what dose?
        •	Is baseline imaging required?
        •	What periodic lab monitoring is required and should be followed by the family physician moving forward?
        
        <p>Although this design would not include rapid assessment and diagnosis of suspected VTE, long-term follow-up for VTE patients, decision-making regarding VTE prophylaxis in obstetrics and cancer patients starting chemo would be the complex type of patient that would be seen in this clinic. Ultimately the goal is to provide an inpatient thrombosis service. It would also lend itself to assisting in follow-up of patients assessed by the PERT team. In the future, allowing for the involvement of a research nurse and PA, then the 2-visit system would also allow for recruitment to VTE research in collaboration with other centres such as Ottawa. We hope to recruit 3-5 thrombosis to help grow the program.

            One year of specialty training is required.
