    <p>Dr.Sniderâ€™s vision for GIM is to establish an inpatient and outpatient procedure service, develop core and GIM residency procedure curriculum, and provide continuing education opportunities to staff as it pertains to procedures/POCUS. An inpatient service will initially involve intermittent coverage; Coverage will at times overlap with other service requirements, such as CTU/consults. With additional staff coverage, an inpatient procedure rotation for residents becomes possible.
    <h2>Future Vision</h2>
    <p>At least 3-5 staff will be needed to provide 75% coverage (M-F, daytime hours) for an inpatient service. Future GIM staff interested in covering this service would ideally have at least 6-12 months of POCUS/procedural training at an accredited POCUS program (12 months preferred). Existing staff interested and comfortable with various procedures of internal medicine would be welcomed to cover. Dr.Snider has established strong connections with University of Calgary POCUS group who are able to provide guidance with getting a service established. They also are quite productive from a research standpoint and expressed interest in future research collaborations.
