    <h2>OBIM - Drs. Laura Chisick and Jessica Cudmore</h2>
    <p>OBIM in Canada is rapidly growing and in Winnipeg we have seen consults and OBIM consults grow tremendously over the last number of years. The Vision for this program is to have a fully functioning inpatient rotation and consult service with 3-5 OBIM trainined physicians over the next 5-10 years. Our inpatient rotation is evolving and we are slowly sending less and less patients over to Calgary for their electives, but this service could benefit from more OBIM staff. Ideally, we would also have an OBIM consult service which residents and trainees could rotate through during their training.   
        <p>To be eligible for this residents must complete a 12 month training program in OBIM.  As staff they are expected to be involved in education, journal clubs, half days and other events. Participation in national research is highly encouraged.
