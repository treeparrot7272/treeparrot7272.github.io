    <p>Within Canada, rates of obesity are expected to continue to increase, leading to our medical system seeing higher rates of weight related comorbidities. The field of Bariatric Medicine is fortunately undergoing significant growth and development. Over the next few years, the therapeutic options will rapidly grow with the aim of reducing these comorbidities and improving patient quality of life.   
    <h2>Future Vision</h2>
    <p>Dr.Crockerâ€™s goal is to create a formal outpatient Bariatric Medicine multidisciplinary program with an initial goal of a group of 4-5 physicians in the next 3-5 years. These physicians can be GIM, endocrinology, and family medicine trained physicians. At minimum, ABOM certification would be required with a formal bariatric fellowship being strongly recommended. Allied health (including a dietitian, physiotherapy, psychologist, nurse practitioner, and clinic manager) will be required. Once established, a bariatric endoscopist should be hired to provide adjunctive endobariatric care. This program ideally would be offered in conjunction with the bariatric surgery program.  
    Education of medical students and residents will be a priority.  She envisions a formal 1+ month rotation for interested residents and fellows. Once additional staff are hired and a formal program is created, a fellowship program can be developed.
